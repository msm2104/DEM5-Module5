# DEM5-Module5
Scenario 

Customer File - Clean customer file - removing duplicates, Seprating First name and Last Name, removing null values 
Library borrowing record -  Date formatting, Days allowed borrow , 

As a library admin I want to automaticvally ingest and clean the flat files I manually curate each day to impress my boss.

How would I do it?
Stage 1 : ingestion - Needs a trigger/schedule - possible matching issues depenedant on src location - 1 master script or 1 for each type

Stage 2 : clean - Need to ID issues - Prepare for dirty dates, duplicates and text character errors - Enforce correct types for Dates and Integers - log all fixes and counts

Stage 3 : Store - Store outputs in DB - aggreagte fixes, create output of impacts / success/ fails etc

In addition: - Log activity at each stage (runtime, errors found etc) - Add logs to a DB for visualisation

To consider: - no current DE systems, new services will be expensive - small bespoke management via scripts be cheaper but will add technical debt
